This solution is written in Groovy.

After solving day 10, I try to catch up with day 8.
Seems to be the easiest of the three missing days 7, 8 and 9.

Again, I will use my helper to read the input from day 10.

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=helper]
....

== First Star

Wow. That was fun!

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=starOne,!starTwo]
....

== Second Star

Since it is only counting the seconds, it is already included in the first part of the source.
And yes, I've got an off by one error when I first submitted my solution *g*
