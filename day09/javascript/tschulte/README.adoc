Today I wanted to use some knowledge gained by watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxzBZpzzzo8.

== First Star

My first idea was to implement a class `Circle` that holds the circle state.
After some back and forth, it ended up having an `addNextMarble` method returning the score of that step.
The `currentMarble` getter is only for testing purposes.

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=Circle]
....

To be able to test the steps, I created a `MarbleGame` class.

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=MarbleGame]
....

And the `parseLine` method just extracts the info from the test input and returns a new `MarbleGame` instance.
Here I used the newly learned spread operator.

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[tags=parseLine]
....

Interestingly the final tests with the examples from the aoc description did not work, but since I could not find an error, I tried the solution with the real input and it was correct.
