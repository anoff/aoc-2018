== Part 1

I chose to put the input data in a separate file and load it using with-open-file (which takes care of closing the file). I then read and sum the lines of input data before finally printing the frequency.

I don't like the names change and frequency but those are terms used in the puzzle so I stuck with them.

== Usage
I use the SBCL Common Lisp Compiler - http://www.sbcl.org/

sbcl --script solution.lisp
