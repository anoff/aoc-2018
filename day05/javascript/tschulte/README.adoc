== First Star

For the first star, we can recursively reduce the string.

[source, js]
....
include::part1.js[]
....

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=part1]
....

== Second Star

The first part of the second star is to first remove all chars of one unit and then reduce

[source,js]
....
include::part2.js[tags=reduceWithoutUnit]
....

The second part is to iterate over all units and try to reduce to find the shortest reduction

[source,js]
....
include::part2.js[tags=findShortestReduction]
....

And the last part is to call `findShortestReduction` with the already compressed string.

[source, js]
....
include::solution.js[tags=part2]
....
