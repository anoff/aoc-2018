== Part 1

For part 1 I just reused my code from link:../../../day16/go/anoff/[day 16]. Some changes were necessary to allow `6 registers` instead of ``4`` that the previous challenge had.
In addition to that I wrote a `program` type that handles the pointer updates and running the correct command.

[source, go]
....
include::./src/solution.go[program]
....

The `program.step()` method executes the next command in the program and returns `true` if the program terminated.

NOTE: My program execution does not manipulate the original register but rather creates a copy, therefore an additonal step is required to update the programs registers.

:update registers;
if (new pointer
is out of bound) then (Y)
  :return true;
else (points to valid command)
  :return false;
endif
end

== Part 2

This one was interesting. At first I thought it might be necessary to build an optimizer into my `program` interpreter. But I did not know where to start so I decided to start decompiling/assembling the program code and bring it into a higher language that allows me to find patterns in the code.

Here are my lengthy thoughts

=== Translate operations into _register language_

To avoid confusion with immediate values the registers are name A B C D E F, where I always noted the pointer register (2) as C*.

I highlighted the sections that seem to implement some sort of conditions.

8   addi 3 1 3    D = D + 1
9   gtrr 3 4 5    F = D > E <2>
10  addr 2 5 2    C* = C* + F   // GOTO 11+F
11  seti 2 4 2    C* = 2        // GOTO 3

15  seti 1 0 2    C* = 1        // GOTO 2
16  mulr 2 2 2    C* = C* * C*  // 16*16 -> EXIT <4>
17  addi 4 2 4    E = E + 2
18  mulr 4 4 4    E = E * E
19  mulr 2 4 4    E = C* * E = 19 * E
20  muli 4 11 4   E = E * 11
21  addi 5 1 5    F = F + 1
22  mulr 5 2 5    F = F * C* = F * 22
23  addi 5 17 5   F = F + 17
24  addr 4 5 4    E = E + F

27  setr 2 3 5    F = C* = 27
28  mulr 5 2 5    F = F * C* = 27*28 = 756
29  addr 2 5 5    F = C* + F = 29 + 756 = 785
30  mulr 2 5 5    F = C* * F = 785 * 30 = 23550
31  muli 5 14 5   F = F * 14 = 329700
32  mulr 5 2 5    F = F * C* = 10550400
33  addr 4 5 4    E = E + F
34  seti 0 9 0    A = 0
35  seti 0 6 2    C* = 0 // GOTO 1
----
<1> line 4 and 5 form an `IF` statement that might skip #7
<2> line 9 and 10 form an `IF` statement that jumps back to #3
<3> 13 and 14 either exit the program or jump back to #2
<4> setting to pointer to 16*16 will reach the end of the program, therefore I noted it as `EXIT`

=== Grouping lines

First I ordered the program in execution order and grouped together all those additions and multiplications. I also rewrote the conditions that I identified in the previous step and use goto-notation for jumps.

[source,text]
----
0       GOTO 17
17..20  E = (E+2) * (E+2) * 19 * 11
21..23  F = (F+1) * 22 + 17
24      E = E + F
25      GOTO #26+A
26      GOTO 1
27..32  F = 10550400
33      E = E + F
34      A = 0
35      GOTO 1

1       B = 1
2       D = 1
3       F = B * D
4..7    if E == F { A = B + A; F = 1 } else {Â F = 0 }
8       D = D + 1
9..11   if D > E { GOTO 12; F = 1 } else {Â GOTO 3; F = 0 }
12      B = B + 1
13..16  if B > E { EXIT; F = 1 } else { GOTO 2; F = 0 }
----

=== Introducing loops

Next step was to aggregate the lines up top even further and actually give them the correct values with the starting conditions of `A=1, B=0, C=0, D=0, E=0, F=0`.

I still kept the previous jump points as a reference.

[source,text]
----
E = 875
F = 10550400          <1>
E = E + F
A = 0
B = 1                  #1

while B <= E {
  D = 1                #2
  while D <= E {
    F = B * D          #3
    if E == F {
      A += B
    }
    D = D + 1
  }
  B++                  #12
}
----
<1> this already includes the double run of #17..35 with A first being 1 and then set to 0

=== `For` loops

In the (almost) last step I rewrote it to use `for` loops instead of `while` as the code clearly loops until something is reached and increments.

[source,go]
----
A = 0
E = 10550400 + 875
for B := 1; B <= E; B++ {
  for D := 1; D <= E; D++ {
    F = B * D
    if E == F {
      A += B
    }
  }
}
print(A)
----

One final observation is that the inner loop and condition actually check if ``B`` is a factor of ``F`` but instead of the looping I can make use of the modulo ``%`` operator in go. The final code is then.

[source,go]
----
A = 0
E = 10550400 + 875
for B := 1; B <= E; B++ {
  if E % B == 0 {
    A += B
  }
}
print(A)
----

This code executes in less than a second so everything is good ðŸ™ƒ
