== Solution written in Typescript

This is just a setup-test.

Typescript runs out of the box in gitpod.

Compile the `.ts` file via

    tsc solution.ts

you can add `--watch` to let `tsc` compile whenever your file changes

Run your code by executing

    node solution.js

But it can be even setup easier with the following shebang:

    #!/usr/bin/env ts-node

In order to make this work, the npm module `ts-node` needs to be installed through

    npm install ts-node -g

This command has been configured in the `.gitpod`-file to get it installed automatically
