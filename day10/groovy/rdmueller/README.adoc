This solution is written in Groovy.

During the first days of this year's advent, I learned a lot about Python.
Now I switch back to my beloved Groovy jsut to be faster.

In order not to lose any time, I've already prepared my working folder and prepared a helper method the day before:

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=helper]
....

== First Star

Wow. That was fun!

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=starOne,!starTwo]
....

== Second Star

Since it is only counting the seconds, it is already included in the first part of the source.
And yes, I've got an off by one error when I first submitted my solution *g*
