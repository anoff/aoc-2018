This solution is written in Groovy.

During the first days of this year's advent, I learned a lot about Python.
Now I switch back to my beloved Groovy jsut to be faster.

In order not to lose any time, I've already prepared my working folder and prepared a helper method the day before:

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=helper]
....

== First Star

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=starOne,!starTwo]
....

== Second Star

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=starTwo]
....
