== Part 1

Given the above types and methods just play rounds until either all elves or all goblins are dead..

== Part 2

Well... took me like `5m 52s` to find the answer but it worked ü§∑‚Äç Getting this one was rather easy after solving part 1. Just increase the elf power until all of them survive.

TIP: One possible optimization I could do is to keep track of the `walkable` tiles for each round/tick. Currently the entire map is scanned for occupatied slots for each shortest path operation. Since there are a bunch for each turn a cached `walkable` list should significantly boost the performance.

== Run solution

1. Get into directory of this README
1. Set gopath to current dir `export GOPATH=$PWD`
1. Install dependency `go get github.com/satori/go.uuid`
1. `cd src`
1. `go build -o solution && ./solution`
1. Profit
