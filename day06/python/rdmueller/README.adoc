== First Star

Seems to be easy.
I first thought that this would be a good fit for mapreduce, but I lack the time.

So, my solution just walks over every character and when it finds a pair, it removes it and jumps back a character in case that this is a chain of reactions.

== Second Star

So, for the second star, I just use the function from the first to iterate over the alphabet and see which element yields the biggest reaction.
