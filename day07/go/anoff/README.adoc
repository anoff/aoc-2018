== Part 1

For this solution I created a surprising amount of helper functions ðŸ¤”

. `Coord` struct that has the properties _id_ (line number in input file), _x_ and _y_ positions
. `init2dSlice(d1 int, d2 int) [][]int` to create a 2D slice of `uint8` values with a fixed size (to prevent reallocation of memory)
. `generateGrid1(coords []Coord, dimX int, dimY int) [][]uint8` generate a 2D grid and populate it with the `Coord.id` of the closest coordinate according to manhatten distance, this generates a grid similar to the example but with numbers instead of letters
. `identifyInfiniteElements(grid [][]uint8) []uint8` takes a grid and returns a slice of integers representing all the _infinite IDs_ that occupy the outer border of the grid
. `identifyGridOccupation(grid [][]uint8) map[uint8]int` loop over the grid and return a map of `(k)Coord.id=(v)count within grid`
. `manhattenDistance(x1 int, y1 int, x2 int, y2 int) int` calculate the manhatten distance between two points
. `extractCoords(input string) Coord` create a `Coord` struct for a single entry from the input

Using the above functions solution for part1 is the following

:init max occurence helpers;
while (for each occuring coord)
  if (current coord has
  new max occurence) then (y)
    if (current coord
    is finite (not touching border)) then (y)
      :update max occurence;
    endif
  endif
endwhile
:print max occuring count + coord.ID;
end

== Part 2

Again the second part seemed to be easier than the first even though it has little reuse of the first solution.

The goal is to find the count of all elements that have a combined manhatten distance `< 10,000` to all coordinates.

:init elementCounter with 0;
while (for each x in grid)
  while (for each y in grid)
    :init distanceSum with 0;
    while (for each coordinate)
      :calculate manhatten distance
      (x,y) to (coord.x, coord.y);
      :add distance to sum;
    endwhile
    if (sum < 10000) then (y)
      :inc elementCounter by 1;
    endif
  endwhile
endwhile
:print count of elements
with distance < 10000;
