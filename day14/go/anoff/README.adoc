== Cooking

I took a while to understand how the _cooking process_ works and how new recipes are selected. But after that the implementation was pretty straight forward. Initially I started out with a string containing the scoreboard and always appending new characters to that string. However that meant for each cooking process I needed to do 2 `String to Int` conversions to get the score of the input recipes and 1 `Int to String` to append the new result to the board string. This was way too slow for the thousands of iterations required for the challenge, so I rewrote it to use a slice of `Integer` s instead.

I implemented the cooking function `cook(board []int, recipe1 int, recipe2 int) ([]int, int, int)` that takes a board and two integers indiciating the index on the board to cook next. It returns an updated board and the recipes to cook next.

== Part 1

To get the result for part 1 I just kept cooking until the board reached the required length.

[plantuml, day14-p1, png]
....
@startuml
skinparam defaulttextalignment center
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false
start
:init board with 3,7;
while (board length not reached)
  :cook;
endwhile
:print the last 10
elements in the board;
end

== Part 2

For this challenge part 2 was pretty easy too ðŸ¤—
I just kept cooking until the last N elements of the board are identical to the input. The answer for part2 is then the number of items on the board minus those of the length of the input.

[plantuml, day14-p2, png]
....
@startuml
skinparam defaulttextalignment center
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false
start
:init board with 3,7;
while ()
  if (more items
  in board than
  input recipes) then (Y)
    if (last N board
    elements match) then (Y)
      :stop the loop;
    endif
  endif
endwhile
:print length of board
minus the length of input recipes;
end

Solution can be run with `go run src/solution.go`

Unit tests can be run with `go test`
